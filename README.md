# Blockchaon-Based-Voting-System
Blockchain based Online Voting System using Multichain (Private blockchain)


The goal of this project was to develop a blockchain based voting system which will simply take the current process of voting 
in an election on Election Day and bring that process entirely online to make it easier, more secure and even more cost effective 
for everyone involved.The system uses a private blockchain to maintain all the voting record in a public blockchain, making it transparent.
•	Used Multichain (private Blockchain) for creating Blockchain.
•	Used MySQL for data base of this system.
•	Used JAVA EE for creating server side of this system.
•	Used HTML/CSS JavaScript and Bootstrap for frontend of this system.
